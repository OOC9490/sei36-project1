# README

This is my first project on rails, the project's basis is the beginnings of a Super Smash Brothers wiki.

## The motivation

I wanted to create a website that would promote the Smash community's involvement, be a good source of information and be an avenue to socialise on

## Things I learned

* Creating a website with CRUD system in using Ruby on Rails
* Managing and testing a deployment through Heroku
* Uploading local files for use on live website

## Technology used

* Rails version: 5.2.4.1
* Ruby version: 2.7.0 
* Heroku 7.39.0
* Cloudinary

## For the future

* Improved search engine implementation
* A more robust infom
* Better linking between articles by using keywords to link to related articles
